# People-Network-A-knowledge-graph-using-Neo4j

A graph database is a graphical representation of data points and the various relationships between them. This form of structure helps retrieve data faster using semantic queries. A knowledge graph is an implementation of the graph database which has found widespread applications in data management, social networks and other areas. In this project we try to build a network of people using Neo4j to understand the intricacies of using a graph database and the structure of a knowledge graph.
